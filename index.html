<p>Colonel John Stapp, M.D., Ph.D., was an American career U.S. Air Force officer, flight surgeon, physician, biophysicist and pioneer in studying the effects of acceleration and deceleration forces on humans. He was a colleague and contemporary of Chuck Yeager, and became known as "the fastest man on earth."
<br><br>
Stapp began studying the effect of crashes and high altitude ejections on pilots using the rocket sled. He most frequently rode the sled himself to avoid endangering other personnel. In his 29th and last ride, Stapp demonstrated that a human can withstand at least 46.2G. (In the forward position, with adequate harnessing.) This is the highest known deceleration voluntarily encountered by a human. Stapp also reached a speed of 632 miles per hour, which broke the land speed record and made him the fastest man on Earth.
<br><br>
Stapp is also credited with being the popularizer of the principle known as Murphy's law ("Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong") and is credited with creating Stapp's Law (or Stapp's Ironic Paradox) which states that: "The universal aptitude for ineptitude makes any human accomplishment an incredible miracle."</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 1946, he became a research officer in the Aeromedical Laboratory of Wright Field, Ohio, where he studied problems of escaping from aircraft at high altitudes</li>
	<li>Provided the effectiveness of a liquid oxygen breathing system and established preventative measures for high altitude bends and dehydration</li>
	<li>At Muroc AFB, California, he made 26 rocket-powered sled runs to test human reactions to high rates of acceleration (35 times that of gravity) and deceleration</li>
	<li>His experiments proved that an ejection seat could be used safely at supersonic speeds</li>
	<li>In 1954, he invited representatives of the military and auto industry to review his research on the necessity of seat belts</li>
